# IMAGING_BIBLIO
This project creates a library full of images, which are created randomly or handmade with a paint option. These images have original randomly created metadata and you can access them by touching each row of the table or by searching for them in the folder hierarchy on the right. It also has several filters and sorting algorithms.
